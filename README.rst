R programming language: conceptual overview
---------------------

**What is it all about?**

This is a presentation on the conceptual overview of R programming language highlighting different concepts and paradigms used in the design of the language (functional programming, OOP, dynamic features etc). It was used to give a workshop on this topic.

The file with the presentation is https://github.com/maxlit/workshops/R/r-advanced-overview/blob/master/r-workshop-general-overview.pdf
You can also find here the source of the few examples in R, python and C# pieces of code used in the presentation.

**Remark**. The source file of the presentation is an *org* file which is converted to a *tex* file which is used to produce the *pdf* file.
